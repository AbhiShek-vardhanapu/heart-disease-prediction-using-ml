Abstract - The foremost reason behind mortality and
hospital admittance across the globe is heart disease.
Thanks to the advancements in technology and computer
engineering, the identification and swift, efficient
treatment of heart conditions have become feasible. This
research paper investigates the role of machine learning
in early heart disease detection using diverse medical
data. The study employs algorithms like Random Forest,
Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, XGBoost, Support
Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbors on medical
records to predict heart disease based on clinical
attributes. Performance evaluation includes accuracy, F1
score, and feature importance analysis. Results
underscore machine learning's potential for precise heart
disease detection, aiding clinical decisions and
personalized treatment.
